# Side Project: Reusable Satellites machine learning prediction
## Intro

🚀 SpaceX slashes launch costs: Falcon 9 launches cost $62M vs. $165M+ for competitors, thanks to reusable first stages.

🔑 First stage matters most: It does most of the work, is very expensive, and reusability drives major savings.

⚠️ Not always recovered: The first stage may crash or be sacrificed depending on payload, orbit, or mission needs.

🎯 The goal: to analyze SpaceX launch data and build an ML model to predict first-stage reuse and estimate launch costs, then can become SpaceX's competitor? ;)

## Data Collection:

Harnessed the SpaceX REST API and web scraping from Wikipedia to gather a rich dataset of Falcon 9 launch history, including mission details, payloads, and landing outcomes.

## Result:

Built and trained a supervised machine learning model that predicts whether a Falcon 9 booster will be successfully recovered — achieving an impressive 94% prediction accuracy.
